    "text": "Challenge\n\n\nWant: 20 collections per species per seed transfer zone\nNative species declining - wildfires, habitat degradation\nMany populations needed as drought, pests, etc. vary each year\nOccurrence data often biased against BLM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohanna Steensma\n\n\n\n\nOn most BLM administered land, we simply have difficulty finding enough populations to collect from. Even populations of once wide-ranging abundant species can be difficult to find in the right condition for a crew to collect from. SOS official guidance is that crews can hope to make collections from 1/4 populations which are large enough, the other 3 are often lost to pests or other eccentricities of the year.\nWhile some good occurrence data exist, once you really zoom in - you realize it’s pretty sparse. For these reasons we need to get crews lot’s of good ideas on where to go scout for their target species."

We accomplish this by using Species Distribution Models - often also called Environmental Niche Models, which can be readily interpreted by crew leads using a GIS.\nThe SDMs we will discuss are constructed from a subset of generally 10-20 predictor variables selected from a raster stack of 44. We model these SDM’s using random forests, which are a very very fast algorithm, and provide reproducible results. The training data come from a variety of musuem and government sources."

To be blunt, most of our seed matures and disperses in a couple batches, once in June to early July, and again in September - if you are in a monsoonal area. It is imperative that crews have found many populations before this happens, and hence that they prioritze their scouting efforts. Searching for the earliest species as soon as possible, and holding off on the later material."

It suffers from both bias, especially due to where training records are located, and variance - associated with noise on the input data and over fitting of parameters. Our crews are focused on finding populations for collections - not mapping new populations ala a conservation focus. We want to get them there.\nNotably then, we want crews to go where they have very high chances of being successful. The discrepancy between the name “species DISTRIBUTION model” and what’s it actually offers have been noted for roughly 20 years ago. In my experience most critiques of SDM’s arise from the mismatch between the nomenclature, and users expectations - and an SDM predicting suitable habitat very far from any currently occupied habitat."

# Background

-   Remote Sensing, Citizen Science, Statistics, and Ecology\
-   research projects focus on theory and shoot for the moon\
-   West very large, lacking distribution data on most species\
<br>
-   What's needed for seed collection?\

::: {.incremental} 
- **Better knowledge of Natural History**
::: 

::: notes
Lot's of absolutely amazing things are happening in ecology these days. 
From the proliferation of Citizen Science initiatives to fancy fancy remote sensing, and amazing advances in statistics. 
However, I generally feel that the developers of these things get carried away with testing these out on theoretical problems, whereas we have many real problems. 
In particular, we've still much work to do in documenting basic natural history - a feat largely abandoned by the main stream 40 years ago. 

Most all of my work is wrangling museum, government, and citizen science data to try and share natural history information with seed collectors - in quick, easy to access digital formats.

# SPACE

<font size="6"> *"It is advisable to look from the tide pool to the stars
and then back to the tide pool again."*\
</font> <br> [John Steinbeck & Ed Ricketts]{style="float:right"}

## Challenge 

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
-   Want: 20 collections per species per seed transfer zone
-   Native species declining - wildfires, habitat degradation
-   Many populations needed as drought, pests, etc. vary each year
-   Occurrence data often biased against BLM

::: notes
On most BLM administered land, we simply have difficulty finding enough populations to collect from. 
Even populations of once wide-ranging abundant species can be difficult to find in the right condition for a crew to collect from. 
SOS official guidance is that crews can hope to make collections from 1/4 populations which are large enough, the other 3 are often lost to pests or other eccentricities of the year. 

While some good occurrence data exist, once you really zoom in - you realize it's pretty sparse. 
For these reasons we need to get crews lot's of good ideas on where to go scout for their target species.

::: notes
Our solution is to communicate the plausible range of individual species to our young collectors. 
We accomplish this by using Species Distribution Models - often also called Environmental Niche Models, which can be readily interpreted by crew leads using a GIS. 

The SDMs we will discuss are constructed from a subset of generally 10-20 predictor variables selected from a raster stack of 44. 
We model these SDM's using random forests, which are a very very fast algorithm, and provide reproducible results. 
The training data come from a variety of musuem and government sources. 
:::

## Implementation

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Crew Leads receive output raster data (two formats) 
  - Masked to >70% prob. of suitable habitat 
  - Raw probability predictions  
- Also receive raw training presences  
- Visually review data while preparing hitches

# TIME

<font size="6"> *"The two most powerful warriors are time and patience"*
</font> <br> [Leo Tolstoy]{style="float:right"}

## Challenge
::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Crews spend 15-25% of work driving  
- Leads often overwhelmed with number (gen. 40-80) of target species  
- Finite windows for scouting and collecting  
- Fruit develops simultaneously

:::

::: notes
So time is really of the essence for our crews. 
To be blunt, most of our seed matures and disperses in a couple batches, once in June to early July, and again in September - if you are in a monsoonal area. 
It is imperative that crews have found many populations before this happens, and hence that they prioritze their scouting efforts. 
Searching for the earliest species as soon as possible, and holding off on the later material.

::: notes
A species distribution model produces one and one metric only - the probability of suitable habitat BASED upon the dependent observations and independent variables you feed in. 
It suffers from both bias, especially due to where training records are located, and variance - associated with noise on the input data and over fitting of parameters. 
Our crews are focused on finding populations for collections - not mapping new populations ala a conservation focus. 
We want to get them *there*. 

Notably then, we want crews to go where they have very high chances of being successful. 
The discrepancy between the name "species DISTRIBUTION model" and what's it actually offers have been noted for roughly 20 years ago. 
In my experience most critiques of SDM's arise from the mismatch between the nomenclature, and users expectations - and an SDM predicting suitable habitat very far from any currently occupied habitat.
:::

## Solution

::: {style="float: left; width: 49%;"}
- Reprocess the output of SDM's to identify clusters of suitable habitat  
- Identify populated patches    
- Rank the connections and classify distance from populated to un-populated patches
